`typescript-ex`
---------------

Is a "hello world" application written on TypeScript. To build and start, run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
Run the application with:

```sh
npm run start
```

And then `curl 127.0.0.1:8080`.

The application serves a crude front page with [Shipwright's][shipwright] logo from
`./assets/images/shipwright-logo.png`, which must be included before the application starts.
